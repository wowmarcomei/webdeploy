                belong to us The top 25 memes of the web’s first 25 years By Gene Park, Adriana Usero and Chris Rukan For
                more of The Web at 25, visit The Washington Post. Memes didn’t begin with the Web, but you’d be forgiven
                for thinking so. The evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins coined the term in his 1976 book, “The Selfish
                Gene,” to describe something that already existed. A meme, from the Greek “mimeme” (to imitate) was “a unit
                of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation.” This encompassed phenomena from Martin Luther’s “95 Theses”
                to the famous graffiti drawing “Kilroy Was Here,” which dates to the beginning of World War II. But the Web
                has proved to be the most fertile ground, and the site Know Your Meme has confirmed more than 2,600 of them.
                Below, 25 definitive memes from the Web’s first 25 years. [1] Dancing Baby 1996: Considered the granddaddy
                of Internet memes, the baby shuffling to Blue Swede’s “Hooked on a Feeling” filled inboxes and prime-time
                airwaves, appearing in several episodes of “Ally McBeal.” The file was originally included with early 3D
                software. LucasFilm developers modified it before it was widely shared, and it was finally compressed into
                one of the first GIFs.
