            <span>Indonesia pointed at Christmas</span>
        </h1>

        <p class="paragraph-content">
            his is how it happens: The most sensible alternative to a life of unbearable hardship is to take a chance on a rubber dinghy
            in Indonesia pointed at Christmas Island, which is part of Australia. If a refugee survives, this person is not
            praised for valor but rather ejected 4,000 miles away to another island. Nauru Regional Processing Center. Processing
            sounds temporary, and it is, in the same way purgatory is temporary. Asylum seekers have been known to wait five
            years for intercession in the form of a “refugee status determination,” or RSD. The agony of waiting is what
            caused the July 2013 riot. RSDs that were promised were not delivered, and asylum seekers protested. They threw
            rocks at police and lit fire to buildings. No one was hurt, but the fires caused $60 million in damage. It was
            probably the most power they’d ever wielded. Nauruan police arrested 153 people around 9:30 p.m. and charged
            them with rioting. But nothing changed. If anything, the detainees were more forlorn than ever. Depression was
            becoming rampant. The older children noticed it, and the little ones, too, though they couldn’t quite understand.
            Something was wrong. Happiness should be easy at that age. But not in Nauru. Once, a teacher noticed her student
            searching the ground for something while waiting for the bus to take him home from school. He was a nice little
            boy. He’d been given something that morning, a sticker. What a thing. But now he’d lost it, and he anxiously
            combed the dirt and gravel. “Leave it,” the teacher said. “You can find it later.” The boy said nothing. He just
            slumped into a pile and sobbed. When the protests of Sept. 30 amounted to nothing, it was as though a reservoir
            of grief broke through the last levee, and hopelessness flooded the little camp. All around were thoughts of
            suicide. One asylum seeker, Yusuf, told his case manager he thought the mood in the camp was worse than ever.
            A week earlier, the Australian government had taken the unprecedented step of paying Cambodia (as it paid Nauru)
            to resettle refugees there. The head of the U.N. refugee agency called it “a worrying departure from international
            norms” because Australia was essentially paying a poor, unsuitable country to take over its own moral and legal
            obligations. But Cambodia wanted the money, Australia didn’t want the refugees and to this day the plan is still
            in place.
