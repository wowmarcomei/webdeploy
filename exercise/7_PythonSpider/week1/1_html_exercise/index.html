            If you had asked me when I was first starting how I imagined my high school experience would go, never in a million years would I have guessed it would go like this.

            When I reintroduced myself to my classmates as Gavin at the beginning of my sophomore year, not much had changed. I was the same as I was the year before -- short, messy hair and exclusively male clothing. The only differences were my name, pronouns, and comfort. I was infinitely happier presenting myself authentically.

            My teachers and classmates respected my identity and called me “he” and “him” when they were talking about me. And, after checking with the principal to make sure it was okay, I started using the boys’ restroom like every other guy in school. Everything was normal. And for a couple of months, nobody seemed to mind.
